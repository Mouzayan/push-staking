# Transition to PushCoreV3: Modular Architecture and Staking Integration

The purpose of this repo is to implement the upgrade from PushCoreV2 to PushCoreV3, introducing a more modular contract architecture. This transition separates the core protocol logic from the staking and fee distribution mechanics, with the creation of PushStaking as a key component of this shift.

### PushCoreV2
Handles core protocol functionality including channel management, staking, and fee collection.  It also manages epochs and rewards distribution as well as stores and manages `PROTOCOL_POOL_FEES` which contribute to staking rewards.

### PushCoreV3
While retaining most of PushCoreV2â€™s functionality related to channel and notification management as well as fee collection, PushCoreV3 delegates responsibilities for staking, epoch management, and reward distribution to PushStaking.
PushCoreV3 integrates with the new PushStaking contract by using `setPushStaking()` to set the address of the PushStaking contract and it introduces `transferProtocolFees()` to enable the transfer of fees to PushStaking to be used as staking rewards.


### Key Differences Between PushCoreV2 and PushCoreV3 + PushStaking
1. Separation of concerns: PushCoreV3 offloads staking and fee distribution to PushStaking.
2. New interface for fee transfer: PushCoreV3 allows PushStaking to pull protocol fees from it, which stakers earn as staking rewards.
3. The new PushStaking contract will not only manage staking for PUSH token holders but will also include staking for Wallets, meaning Wallets of projects that integrate Push Protocol features. Staking rewards are divided into two distinct pools: one for Token Holders and one for Integrator Wallets.
4. Integrator Wallets are added or removed by governance, and this action serves as the equivalent of staking or unstaking for those wallets.
5. Staking rewards are distributed proportionally between the Token Holder and Integrator Wallet pools. For example, 70% of the pool fees may go to token holders, while the remaining 30% is allocated to Wallet integrators.
For more details, please refer to the [Push Staking Specification](https://pushprotocol.notion.site/Push-Staking-v3-111188aea7f4806c94edd1d85d2eadbb#111188aea7f48024ba1fd6e26bbbaef5).

### PushStaking
PushStaking is a new contract that takes over some responsibilities from PushCoreV2/V3.
1.	Staking Management: Handles the core staking mechanics, including staking, unstaking, and calculating rewards for users.
2.	Fee Management: Implements `pullProtocolFees()` to retrieve fees from PushCoreV3 and divides them into separate pools: `WALLET_FEE_POOL` and `HOLDER_FEE_POOL`.
3.	Reward Distribution: Manages the distribution of rewards from the fee pools to stakers based on their stakes.
4.	Configurable Fee Distribution: Allows governance to adjust the percentages for fee distribution between the Token Holder and Wallet Integrator pools.
